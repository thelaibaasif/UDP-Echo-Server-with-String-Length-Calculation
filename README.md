# UDP Echo Server with String Length Calculation-Computer Networks 


## Description
This project implements a simple UDP client-server connection in C. The client sends a message to the server, and the server echoes the same message back to the client while also calculating the length of the string. The client then displays the echoed message and its length.

## Features
- UDP connection setup between client and server.
- Client sends a message to the server.
- Server echoes the message back to the client.
- Server calculates the length of the message.
- Client displays the echoed message and its length.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler for C programming.
- Basic understanding of UDP/IP networking.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thelaibaasif/UDP-Echo-Server-with-String-Length-Calculation/
   cd udp-echo-server
